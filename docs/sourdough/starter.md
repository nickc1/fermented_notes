- Widemouth quart mason jar
- Small, non-metallic spoon

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup organic rye flour
- 1/2 cup organic wheat flour
- Non-chlorinated water 

## Directions

### Day 1

Combine 1/2 cup rye flour, 1/2 cup wheat flour, and enough water to make it into a thick pancake batter.

### Day 2+

Discard a 1/2 cup of the starter and add 1/4 cup of rye flour and 1/4 cup of wheat flour. Continue this until you have a starter that doubles in size.
