# Crumpets

## Ingredients
- 1 cup sourdough discard
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 2 Tbsp coconut oil


## Directions
- Combine all ingredients
- Scoop into an oiled [crumpet ring] on a cast iron pan
- Cook until baked all the way through

I sometime end up just flipping them and making something closer to an english muffin.
